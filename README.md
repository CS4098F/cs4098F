Repository for CS4098 Group F


Installation: 

1) Install flask 
2) Install sqlalchemy
3) Run make within the pml folder

Issues encountered: 

Able to build a simple web application with flask but unable to link it with the pmlchecker tool. 
Attempted to use initially a sql architecture to store input pml code to then be used as input for pmlcheck. 
Decided to use SQLAlchemy as our sql tool for storing small numbers of items in a local file to be used as a type of proxy database.
Similarly had issues displaying pmlcheck output.
Attempted to use cgi to update our webapp but was unable to pull results from pmlcheck to do so.
